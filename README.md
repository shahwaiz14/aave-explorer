### What is Aave?
Aave is  a decentralized liquidity market protocol where depositors can deposit their assets to earn yield and borrowers can borrow assets by providing sufficient collateral.

### What does this app contain?

2. Aaveâ€™s daily and hourly price
3. Recent withdrawal, lending, and borrowing activities on the platform
4. It also allows you to enter transaction ID and see its details, like amount & asset lent/deposited
5. Finally, you can add a user_id and see their lending and borrowing activities, such as the total amount lent, top assets lent, and more.
6. It also allows you to pick an asset from the drop down list and see its historical APY for both lending and borrowing over a chosen date range. You can also input the amount you would like to lend or borrow and it will show you the *estimated* amount you will earn or owe by the end of that time period.
